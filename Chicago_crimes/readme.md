## Chicago Crime Analysis for 2017

In Chicago, crime has been tracked by the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Records since the beginning of the 20th century. The city's overall crime rate, especially the violent crime rate, is higher than the US average. Chicago was responsible for nearly half of 2016's increase in homicides in the US, though the nation's crime rates remained near historic lows as of 2016.Some attribute the city's strong gang culture to the city's unusually high crime rate compared to neighboring cities, and some do not. To have a perspective on the security of the city of Chicago I have defined a few questions.

Here is the list of these questions:

- Which crimes are most frequently committed in the city of Chicago?
- How many arrests are made in Chicago in the year 2017?
- What is the trend of the number of crimes happening in Chicago in the year 2017?
- Which locations are these frequent crimes being committed to?
- Where a certain crime type is most likely to happen?
- How many of the reported crimes are domestic crimes?
- Which district in Chicago has highest number of reported crimes?
- Mapping the areas where the crime has happened.

To answer these questions, I have taken the three main steps data analysis which are respectively,data pre-processing, data analysis, and data visualization.
